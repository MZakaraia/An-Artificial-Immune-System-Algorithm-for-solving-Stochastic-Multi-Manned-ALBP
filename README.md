# Artificial-Immune-System-Algorithm-for-solving-Stochastic-Multi-Manned-ALBP
This is a Github repository for an Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm designed to solve the Stochastic Multi-Manned Assembly Line Balancing Problem (ALBP).

The AIS algorithm is a heuristic optimization method inspired by the behavior of the natural immune system. It is a population-based algorithm that uses antibody-antigen interactions to search for optimal solutions.

# Requirements

This implementation requires Python 3.6 or higher, and the following Python packages:

    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
